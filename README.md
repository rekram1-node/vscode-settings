# vscode-settings

vs code config files so that I can easily replicate my developer environment at least on MacOS machines


I should also had my local git config I think, maybe a whole repo that is just a one stop shop for all configuration, VSCODE, ZSH, GIT, etc




So far I like these settings!

Keep learning vim motions ;)
