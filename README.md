# vscode-settings

vs code config files so that I can easily replicate my developer environment at least on MacOS machines

TODO:

Write script that will update local settings from this repo by appending vim and keybinding settings while not overwriting anything else


I should also had my local git config I think, maybe a whole repo that is just a one stop shop for all configuration, VSCODE, ZSH, GIT, etc
